            <h1>Water Hashira</h1>
            <small>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</small>
            <p>Giyu Tomioka is the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, one of the nine most powerful swordsmen in the organization. Known for his stoic demeanor and exceptional swordsmanship, Giyu is a master of Water Breathing techniques. Despite his cold exterior, he carries a deep sense of responsibility and guilt from his past. He was the first person to recognize Tanjiro's potential and Nezuko's unique nature, showing his ability to see beyond conventional thinking. His signature haori, split between a solid red and geometric pattern, represents the two people most important to him - his late sister and his best friend Sabito.</p>
